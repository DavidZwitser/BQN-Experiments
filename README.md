## Random experiments in BQN using Raylib

Import one in `main.bqn` to select it to run.\
Use `nix run` in your terminal to run it.

A lot of them are currently probably not working; will fix that later.\
I might also make a nice UI to select them from.

#### Need on your system
[Nix](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer/) installed.
